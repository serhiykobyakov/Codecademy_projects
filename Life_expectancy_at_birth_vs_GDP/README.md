# How environment affects our lifespan?

How to live a long and happy life? Isn't this an old question people have been asking themselves for a long time in our civilization?

Is there a simple answer to this question?

A lot of scientific studies shows that a large number of factors affect human longevity. Some of them are physical like quality of air and food, weather, atmospheric pressure etc. Others are psychological (person's mindset, communication quality with our closest relatives and at work), cultural and even *. Some factors influence us directly, other - indirectly. Some factors have immediate effect, some other - delayed. Also, some factors are interrelated with each other, and we can say with full confidence: the situation is very complicated.

It is impossible to distinguish only one or few factors and use them as a basis to develop the strategy for long and healthy life.

However, statistics may suggest some general approach to solve a complicated problem. Among other, statistics define and aggregate parameters which can sum up effects of several factors into one-number estimation.

Statistically, expected lifespan can be described as **life expectancy at birth**: how long, on average, a newborns are expected to live, if current death rates do not change. Technically, it is an estimation of newbon's lifespan, not it's actual average years of life [^1].

An aggregate parameter, which describes factors influencing the lifespan, is country's **gross domestic product** (GDP): the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a countryâ€™s borders in a specific time period (a year if nothing else is stated). GDP describes the particular country's life environment since not only GDP defines the level of life, but also citizens of the coutry, living their life, define GDP.
